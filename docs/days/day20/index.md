This is another optional tutorial.  If you plan on using ABLATE inside another application or if you would like to call ABLATE directly (not through an input file) this guide illustrates how.  Follow the [Client Library](https://ablate.dev/content/development/ClientLibrary.html) guide on ABLATE.dev to get started.

**Goals**
1. Follow the [Client Library](https://ablate.dev/content/development/ClientLibrary.html) to create an example client library.
